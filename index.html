howdy dumbass. my name is caitlyn<br>
  <br> 
I am a nursing major.<br> 

	  <h1 style="color:#F4BB44;">My interests are watching scary movies/ serial killer documentaries, listening to any kind of music, and hanging out with my dog.</h1>

	  
	  <br>
	  <br> The only videogames i've ever played were basic childhood games... mario, sonic, guitar hero. <br>
	  This class seemed interesting and something completely out of my comfort zone... can't wait to learn what queer games are
